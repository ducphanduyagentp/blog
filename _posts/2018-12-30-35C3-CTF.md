This is my first time participating in C3 CTF. Although I wasn't able to solve many challenges within the time of the CTF, I still find the challenges really awesome and exciting. I wanted to solve pwnable challenges with the hope to learn more about exploit development of real applications, but ended up solving 2 RE ones. Here is my writeup for them :)

## RE - Corebot

This challenge is a 32-bit Windows binary. When I tried running the binary for the first time, it was odd because it didn't prompt for any input and just printed out `NOPE.` However, the logic of the binary is pretty straight forward:

- There is a sequence of API calls to crypto-related functions such as:
    - `CryptAcquireContext`
    - `CryptImportKey`
    - `CryptSetKeyParam`
    - `CryptDecrypt`
- There is a API call to `GetVolumeInformation` to get information of the partition that the binary is on. Only the serial number of the volume is relevant to the rest of the challenge.
- The binary performs some comparison at the end of the `_start` function after decrypting some data. It will print out `NOPE.` if the decrypted data doesn't starts with some predefined bytes (in this case, it is the flag prefix `35C3`)

This reminds me a lot of level 4 of this year Flare-on challenge, which was also a windows binary involving some data decryption. Although this is much simpler, there are at least these 2 ways to solve this:

- Statically reverse engineer the encryption and figure out what is the correct input that satisfies the condition after some data is decrypted.
- Bruteforce the input.

The problem now is to find what data affect the comparison since it doesn't prompt for any user input. It turned out that the binary use the serial number mentioned above to carry out the calculation. The serial number is a 32-bit integer. However, only the lower 16-bit (or 2 bytes) are used for the calculation

![corebot-1](/assets/img/35c3/corebot1.png)

With only 2 bytes being used, I chose to bruteforce the data immediately. This time, I decided to use the `radare2` scripting engine `r2pipe` to solve this so that I can learn it at the same time. `r2pipe` is really awesome because it can actually carry out commands as if you were interacting with `radare2` to debug the binary. Since there is no user input, the data has to be modified during execution. The idea is to set a breakpoint right after the program get the serial number and modify the register accordingly.

I am certain that my script can be further optimized, but it was good enough to solve the challenge in-time. There were a few problems that I encountered while writing the script:

- The code is unmapped before it was execute so I have to figure out the mapped addresses to set the necessary breakpoints.
- The script run fairly slowly because I have to open a whole new `radare2` process for every trial. I think there is a way to redirect the execution so that it doesn't have to run from scratch like that, but reuses the data it obtained before. I optimized it a little bit by running 2 threads and printing the output while it is running. I've tried with more threads but it bugged out after a while. While it was still running, I looked for the flag string in the output and figured out the flag and the correct bytes to be `0x25c3`. The flag is `35C3_MalwareAuthorKryptoChef`.

If you know of a way that I can further optimize this, I would love to know since this is my first time solving a challenge with `r2pipe`.

Anyway, here's the script:

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import r2pipe
from multiprocessing.dummy import Pool as ThreadPool

hook_1 = 0x19a
hook_2 = 0x13f
flags = []

def r2Breakpoint(r2, addr):
    r2.cmd('db {}'.format(addr))

def solve(key):
    r2 = r2pipe.open('corebot.exe', flags=['-2'])
    r2.cmd('aaa')
    r2.cmd('doo')
    r2.cmd('dc')

    # Figure out the mapped addresses
    memmap = r2.cmd('dm').split('\n')
    memmap = [x for x in memmap if 'corebot.exe' in x and '.text' in x][0]
    memmap = memmap.split('-')[0]
    memmap = int(memmap, 16)

    # Then set the breakpoints
    r2Breakpoint(r2, hex(memmap + hook_1))
    r2Breakpoint(r2, hex(memmap + hook_2))
    r2.cmd('dc')

    # The breakpoint is hit. Modify the register here
    eax = r2.cmd('dr?eax')
    eax = int(eax, 16)
    eax = (eax >> 16) << 16
    eax += key
    seteax = 'dr eax={}'.format(hex(eax))
    r2.cmd(seteax)
    eax = r2.cmd('dr?eax')

    # Continue running and hit the breakpoint where the output is going to be printed out.
    # Fetch the output then print it out.
    r2.cmd('dc')
    buffer = r2.cmd('pv @esp+4')
    flag = r2.cmd('pvz @{}'.format(buffer))
    r2.cmd('q')
    print(key, flag)
    return str(key), flag

def main():
    pool = ThreadPool(2)
    results = pool.map(solve, range(0x10000))
    pool.close()
    pool.join()
    for r in results:
        print(repr(r))
    f = open('output.txt', 'wb')
    f.write(''.join([' == '.join(x) for x in results]))
    f.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

# 0x25c3
```

## RE - 0pack

This is not a hard challenge, but it's still a little bit tricky to solve. When I opened the binary in a disassembler, the functions were all `0` as described. Running the binary and giving it some dummy input resulted in the string `Awwww ಠ_ಠ` to be printed. 

![0pack-1](/assets/img/35c3/0pack1.png)

As expected, this is some kind of binary packing. I thought the binary will be calling the main function at some point. I gave it a shot by placing a breakpoint at the call to `__libc_start_main` with the hope that the address of the real main function would be revealed here. And it was. I realized this because of the reference to the prompt `Input password:`

After a quick look at this function, I made the following observations:

- The function gets the input then perform byte-by-byte comparison of the input. This is an example of the comparison of 1 byte. If the comparison fails, it sets a variable to 0 but doesn't immediately stop the process. There are 14 such comparisons so the password is 14-byte long.

    ```

    ```
- In each comparison, a function at `0x557b2e3e8927` is called. This function calls another function which involves the `cpuid` instruction, so my guess was that it detects virtual machines.

I was able to go through all such comparisons manually and extract the password: `ThisIsATriumph`. I think my guess about the VM detection was correct since I was running the binary inside a VM and the extracted password didn't result in a "winning-output". I submitted the flag and it was correct :)
