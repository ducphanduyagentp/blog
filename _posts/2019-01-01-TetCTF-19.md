### IQTest2

- After looking at the source code, there is a path that we can polute the `$level` variable to pass. It has to pass several condition check:

```php
if (isset($_COOKIE['saved']) && !empty($_COOKIE['saved']) && isset($_COOKIE['hash']) && !empty($_COOKIE['hash']))
{
  $saved = base64_decode($_COOKIE["saved"]);
  $seed = urldecode(substr($saved, 5 ));
}

if( md5($GLOBALS['secret'].$seed) === $_COOKIE['hash'] )
{    
  $level = $GLOBALS["seed_key"][$seed];
  if ($level === NULL)
  {
    $saved = "level=i&".$saved;
    $exp = explode("&", $saved);
    foreach($exp as $value)
    {
      parse_str($value);
    }
  }
  ...
}
```

- For this to work:
    - `$saved` gotta be `level=xiii` or something similar
    - `$seed` must not match any valid seed so `$level` is null
    - So previously `$saved` is `b64encode("level=xiii")` and so `$seed` is `=xiii`
    - Which means `md5($GLOBAL['secret']."=xiii") === $_COOKIE['hash']`
- But we also knows pairs of hashes/part of plaintext is the seed.

### Easy webserver

- This is a webserver written in C/C++. It has several functionalities at the first glance
    - login
    - describe the challenge
    - download server-side code and binary
    - Process requests to the additional endpoints:
        - /secret
        - /login
        - /info
        - /chung96vn
    - Some handle POST requests as well
- This binary is complex because of C++ but I figured out that it uses asio library
- Examining strings reveals responses to the requests. I was able to leak the admin password by sending a wrong password of length 0x100. Somehow this input is placed right before the actual admin password and the server echo the wrong password back, therefore leaking the admin password.
- Logging in reveal more functionalities
    - Submit a payload of (what seems like) an arbitrary length. The payload is placed in a file in `info/<ip>/<ip>.txt`
    - GET request to the /info entry read the file and responds with it. However, this endpoint checks if the `ip` GET param starts with the IP address of the request. If it doesn't, the request is disregarded.
- Tracing the binary and threads I was able to see what's passed into the functions and syscalls. It uses some like stat, openat. Attempt to do path traversal was not successful.
- Maybe this is a race condition because it open files and write to it? What if we write different stuffs to the file multiple times in a short duration.
- Yeah there was a race, but I'm not sure where to go from here.
- Maybe the param to /info is read into a global buffer and it wasn't lock properly. So we can somehow cause a race to make the server open `secret/flag` while checking some path that starts with our IP?

### Baby Sandbox

- The program is just a simple stack buffer overflow. 64-bit, only NX so we can probably ROP. It's also statically linked so there is likely to be enough gadgets.
- The sandbox has all protections on.
- The following syscalls are filtered:
    - 59: sys_execve
    - 322: stub_execveat
    - 2 with flag: sys_open
    - 257 with flag: sys_openat
    - 304 with flag: sys_open_by_handle_at
    - 57: sys_fork
    - 58: sys_vfork
    - 56: sys_clone
    - 86: sys_link
    - 0xb: munmap in x64 and execve in x86
- I ended up building a super dirty ROP chain to read more payload from another connection. That's the hardest part because of the limited payload length. After that, it's easy to make fixed memory segments executable and execute shellcode on that.
- The interesting sandbox bypassing techniques I've learned while researching for this challenge:
    - Change the architecture so the syscall number is different and won't be blacklisted.
    - Kill the parent process
    - Fork itself

### Babyheap

- This is a typical heap challenge interface with a jump table:
    - alloc
    - edit
    - delete
    - show
- Alloc:
    - Doesn't prompt for a size.
    - Also doesn't have canary (strange...)
    - Alloc fixed size of 0x98 and store in a global array, max 6 chunks
- Edit:
- Delete:
    - Free then set 0 at the global array
- Show:
    - Magic: %ld
    - Content: %s
- The size of the allocated memory is exactly the sum of the member sizes. When using scanf, the last newline byte will be replaced with a null byte, results in 1-byte overflow into the next chunk's size.

- This is glibc 2.23 so we can use the main_arena leak:
    - Allocate 2 chunks.
    - Free the first chunk then allocate again.
    - Show the first chunk and the address of `main_arena` will be shown.

- The first idea I've got about the one-byte overflow is to first allocate some chunks of the same size, and then free 2 in the between, then modify the marginal chunks to overwrite the header of the freed chunks so when we allocate again, `malloc` will return a different pointer than we usually expect.
- Something can probably be done based on the "shrinking free chunks" attack. But since the malloc size is fixed here, to get larger freed chunks, we can allocate and free 2 consecutive chunks so they coalesce.
- To bypass the `p->next->prevsize == p->size` check, we need to add fake `prevsize` to the chunk in between before freeing it.
- Real size is 0xa0
- Heap can be leaked by allocating at least 3 chunks and free 2 non-consecutives so the fd and bk in each are populated. Then allocate the chunk again and dump it.

- Need to allocate 5 chunks so when freeing 3, top chunk is not coalesced
- Need to fix fd and bk of chunk 1 to manipulate the unlink
- whatever in the fd and bk will be put onto the unsorted bin after the unlink. Then the thing in it will be returned in the next malloc
    fd + 8 * 4 == fd -> bk == P
    bk + 8 * 3 == bk -> fd == P
    fd -> bk = bk
    bk -> fd = fd
- Layout:
    ```python
    0x000:  Chunk 0
    0x0a0:  Chunk 1
    0x140:  Chunk 2
    0x1e0:  Chunk 3
    0x280:  Chunk 4
    0x320:  Chunk 5
    Need 0x1a0 to be 0x100 to be persistent with Chunk 1's size
    malloc_hook malloc_hook + 8
    main_arena  main_arena + 8
    ```

- I've just figured out that we can corrupt the prev_size of the next chunk as well, in addition to the first byte of the size to be 0.
    - Shrink size of the free chunk or current chunk.
- Oh man I've just figured out, too, that it's not an off-by-one but off by many wtf.

- Okay here's a new approach
    - alloc 0 1 2
    - make fake chunk inside 1 
        - 0 | 1 corrupted | fake chunk(s)
    - corrupt size of 1 using 0
    - free 1
    - Corrupt size to make 1 a fast chunk?? Then make more fast chunks to turn this into a fastbin attack?

- So the idea is to eventually make a chunk of 2 different size appear in the unsorted bin so when 1 get allocated, the other still in the free list and we can manipulate it to create a fake chunk inside and then get it to return a desired pointer.

- SO here's another approach
    - Allocate all chunks. The target is to corrupt the prev_size of chunk 4 to `0x200` so when we free it, we have to to unlink a fake chunk at `0x320 - 0x200 = 0x120`
    - Fake chunk will be created inside chunk 1
    - Shrink a chunk and do the thing and free it so it unlink with the fake chunk

- Can't overwrite the prev_size if the prev chunk is freed :(
- Wait. If I can overlap with the top chunk so I can control 2 chunk while it's both free and allocated :o
- SO new plan
    - Get the overlap at chunk 1
    - When allocate again chunk 2 is the same as chunk 1
    - Allocate 3 and 4 then do the trick above. Free 2 so the prev_in_use bit is unset be we can still overwrite the prev_size. This will allow 3 to unlink a fake chunk when we free it.
- Surprisingly freeing the overlap chunk put it in unsorted bin and we can control the bins while it's on the free list. Here we go
- Now I can write a pointer to the heap (actually it's address of main_arena) to what seems like an arbitrary location
- Alright so eventually I've found out that it's a FILE structure exploit where I can overwrite `_IO_list_all` with the address of an unsorted bin. We can get the shell by triggering an error and all the file pointers will be closed. Basically we'll overwrite the address of `_IO_OVERFLOW` in the FILE vtable with `system`. In addition, we need to forge a FILE structure to satisfy some condition so the overwritten `_IO_OVERFLOW` function is called. The FILE structure will be at the smallbin of size 0x60 (smallbin[4])
- Need vtable address at 0x218
- Actually what we did is pointing `_IO_list_all` to a fake filestream and a fake vtable and in that vtable the entry of `_IO_OVERFLOW` is `system` as we set it up.

### Babyfirst

- The binary has all protections on.
- The binary implements its own read function.
- The binary reads a password of length 0x20 from /dev/urandom
- Login function:
    - If the username starts with `admin` then prompt for a password.
    - Otherwise save the username to the buffer and count that as a logged in user.
- Leak password:
    - Input an accepted username of length 0x20 so it reaches the password buffer. The username must not starts with `admin` so it can be saved to the buffer without a password.
    - Choose to play so the username with the password is printed out.
- Play function:
    - It reads input of length 128 maximum and output it. This is stack overflow so we can leak the canary, binary base and libc base all in here.
    - After that, this can be a normal BoF challenge.

- Initially I made a call to `system("/bin/sh")` but it didn't work. My guest was that this new glibc 2.27 does some additional checks so the function can't be called directly like that. That's why I ended up doing a `sys_execve` instead.
